https://hackathon.venom.network/

TrustEstate is a new identity service set to transform the real estate market in Dubai.

## Introduction

TrustEstate uses SSI technologies backed by Venom blockchain to establish
a secure and trusted model for agent-client interactions on Dubai Real Estate Market.

Suppose we have a real estate owner Alice and a real estate buyer Bob. Alice placed an advertisement
on a Real Estate Web Portal. Bob contacted her and they meet.

The problem is how would Bob trust that the person in the front of him is an owner 
of the property in the question, not a fraudster? In the paper ages the only solution is for Alice to reveal her passport
and other paper documents to verify her real estate ownership rights. There are many inconveniences with such an approach.
Alice have to bear the precious papers with her, in risk to lose them or get them stolen. 
Alice reveals her private data for many people, buyers, when the only thing required is an authorized fact that she has the specific right.

In the digital are, here comes the SSI soluion.
